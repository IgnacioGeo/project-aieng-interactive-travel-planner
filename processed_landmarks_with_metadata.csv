San Cristóbal and its northerly neighbor ofLas Bocas Canyonare part of a larger canyon system belonging to theLa Plata Riverbasinin the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico.[3][4][5]\n The San Cristóbal Canyon is mainly carved by the flow of theUsabón River, an eastward tributary of theLa Plata River(Río de la Plata), which at approximately 46 miles (74 km) is the longest river in Puerto Rico. The river flow of the Usabón is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usabón functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls (Salto La Vaca), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island.[4]This canyon system is much bigger than the San Cristóbal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata inComeríoandArroyatainCidra. This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m).[3]\n Before the flow of the Usabón River, the area where the San Cristóbal Canyon is located was the location of a formerfault lineduring theLate Cretaceousperiod. This fault line might have contributed to the inward flow of previous rivers by creating a depression next to a rise of the superficial terrestrial crust along the region which began the process of carving the gorge approximately 90 million years ago. This hydrological process caused the movement of sediments which today are evident in the rich diversity of soil types that are found in the area.[3]\n",18.17,-66.29,"San Cristóbal Canyon (Spanish: Cañón de San Cristóbal) is a canyon carved by the Usabón River, located on the town boundary between the municipalities of Barranquitas and Aibonito in the central region of the main island of Puerto Rico.

The urban forest has entrances onRoosevelt Avenueand Ensenada Street. The forest extends to almost 70 acres and it is the smallest protected area in the Puerto Rico state forest system. One of the most distinctive features of the forest is themogoteon its northern edge which can be observed from many parts of San Juan andGuaynabo.[1]The forest is part of theNorthern Karst.\n The site of the forest was first developed foragricultureandcattle grazingand used to be a farm calledFinca San Patricio. There used to be three mogotes on the site but two were destroyed to make way for the construction of the Villa Borinquen neighborhood and the Borinquen Towers complex. The third mogote still exists and it hosts a communications tower. The rest of the land was originally acquired by the US Army with the intention of developing residences for nearbyFort Buchanan.[1]In 1962 the city of San Juan was experiencing a population boom and urban sprawl destroyed much of the original forest areas of the region. The area where the forest is located was not spared as if it was cleared to make way for more neighborhoods, and the only part of the forest to remain relatively untouched was that around the only remaining mogote. In 1960, the army left and abandoned the residences there and from 1974 to 1999 most of those residences were demolished.[2]At the time the land was owned by the governmental Corporation for Housing and Urban Development (Spanish:Corporación de Renovación Urbana y Vivienda) or CRUV (today known as thePuerto Rico Department of Housing) and the land was intended to be developed to build housing of social interest but these were never built and the modern forest started to grow in the abandoned land. The area was considered one of the last green zones in San Juan and as such in 1998 the environmentalist groupCiudadanos Pro Bosque San Patricio,[3]along with scientists and local residents, pushed to have the land be proclaimed a forest preserve. On August 3, 2000, the forest is proclaimed through an executive order and granted to thePuerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources(DRNA) to manage and preserve the secondary forest and its ecology.
